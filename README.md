### Code Curious Creative

I had previously dabbled a little with basic HTML but fell in love with web programming while [furthering my knowledge](https://github.com/spezzers/spezzers/blob/main/education/certificate-fullstack.png?raw=true) via the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course provided by University Helsinki.

Now, I'm toying with front-end/jamstack technologies and would love to turn this web-dev obsession into a career.
