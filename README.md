### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
<!--
**spezzers/spezzers** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

About a decade after graduating with a degree in graphic design, I had - for the first time ever - that feeling of "this is what I want to do with my life!". This previously elusive passion came to me at last while studying an online full stack web development course.

With a design background, I find myself leaning more towards the front end of the web, and have a particular interest in animation.

I'm super excited to make myself useful, pursue a new career, develop my skills, craft awesomeness, and get involved with open-source projects!
