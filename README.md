### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About a decade after graduating university, I realised - for the first time ever - that "this is what I want to do with my life!". The discovery came to me while deviating from my degree subject of *Graphic Design & Illustration* and studying the [[Full Stack Open]] web development course provided by University Helsinki.

Perhaps favouring front-end development, where I can utilise my graphic skillset, I'm particularly interested in exploring the potentials of web-based animation.

<!-- good short line for a brief bio ? -->
I'm super excited to develop my skills, and some awesome web experiences.
